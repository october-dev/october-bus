# Adapter contract

An adapter connects one harness execution to October Bus without changing protocol semantics.

## Required lifecycle

1. Receive a scope credential through a protected bootstrap channel.
2. Register a stable logical agent ID and a new execution.
3. Keep the scope credential outside the harness process.
4. Give the harness only its execution-bound agent credential, or keep it inside a tool bridge so the harness holds no Bus token.
5. Configure the public HTTP or MCP endpoint.
6. Renew the lease outside the model loop.
7. Stop Bus access if execution authority is replaced. A managed launcher stops its child; a configuration-only adapter closes its bridge, not an unrelated editor process.
8. Retire the execution during clean shutdown: revoke its authority and transactionally release its claims and inbox reservations. Merely marking it offline is insufficient.
9. Allow lease expiry to recover authority and held work after an unclean shutdown.

## Required behavior

An adapter MUST:

- use exact agent IDs for programmatic addressing;
- declare only capabilities it implements;
- preserve durable inbox and acknowledgement behavior;
- keep task claims tied to the current execution;
- keep heartbeat active while the execution holds a claim;
- preserve the harness's own permission system;
- keep tokens out of logs and shared configuration;
- report only lifecycle and readiness states supported by host evidence;
- document pull-only delivery when it cannot wake the host;
- cleanly identify its harness, adapter, and supported protocol version.

## Optional behavior

An adapter MAY provide native hooks for wake, working, idle, needs-input, completion, or bounded-context mapping. Every optional claim requires a matching conformance test.

## Manifest

Each adapter includes `adapter.json`, validated by [adapter-manifest.schema.json](schemas/adapter-manifest.schema.json). The manifest identifies the adapter version separately from the harness and Bus versions.

An `experimental` manifest describes integration work but is never compatibility evidence. Only a `verified` manifest with current public evidence can appear in the compatibility registry.

## MCP adapter profile

The automated MCP adapter profile verifies the executable adapter separately from a harness. A passing adapter run is necessary, but is not compatibility evidence for a named harness. Harness evidence additionally requires a released harness version to complete the verification runbook through that adapter.

The complete MCP adapter profile requires that the adapter and released harness can:

1. start through the adapter with an execution-bound agent credential;
2. remain leased through heartbeat owned outside the model loop;
3. discover a linked peer by exact agent ID;
4. send, receive, and acknowledge durable notifications and requests;
5. return a response linked to its request;
6. retry one logical send without creating a duplicate;
7. exchange bounded context;
8. create, claim, release, reclaim, and complete dependency-aware tasks;
9. create a human escalation without resolving it as the agent;
10. lose authority when its execution is replaced;
11. retire itself during clean shutdown and recover through lease expiry after an unclean exit; and
12. keep scope credentials out of the harness process and logs.

Pull-only delivery is allowed when it is declared as a limitation. Platform and optional lifecycle claims require evidence for each claimed environment.

The reference self-registering mode is `mcp stdio --scope <id> --agent <id>`. The bridge reads a protected local scope-token file, owns its session and retires on EOF, cancellation or heartbeat failure. Configuration contains identities/paths, never credentials. Two windows using the same agent ID replace one another; choose separate IDs for concurrent agents. `--check-self-registration` adds this lifecycle to the executable conformance profile when used with `--start-runtime`.

Optional `configuration` metadata in an adapter manifest describes its embedded template, documented host location, format and conservative inbox wait. It is setup data, not a second compatibility registry or proof of a released-host run.
